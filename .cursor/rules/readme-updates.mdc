# README Updates

Whenever a notable change to the project architecture, data, features, or results is made, it must be documented in the README.md file under the "Project history" section.

## Section Heading Style

All section headings (## level and below) in the README must use **sentence case** (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns), not title case.

Examples:
- ✅ "Hugging Face dataset creation" (not "Hugging Face Dataset Creation")
- ✅ "pH prediction workflow" (not "pH Prediction Workflow")
- ✅ "Data processing" (not "Data Processing")
- ✅ "Project overview" (not "Project Overview")

## Format for Documenting New Features/Scripts

When adding documentation for new scripts or features to the README, follow this pattern:

1. **Main section heading** (## level)
2. **Brief description paragraph** - One or two sentences describing what the script/feature does
3. **Usage code block** (if applicable) - Place immediately after the description, before any details
4. **Details section** - Use a collapsible `<details>` block with:
   - Summary text: "Details"
   - Additional description paragraphs
   - Bullet points for key features/capabilities

Example structure:

```markdown
## Feature name

Brief description of what the feature/script does and its purpose.

```bash
# Usage example
command --option value
```

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

Additional description and context about how it works.

- **Feature 1**: Description
- **Feature 2**: Description
- **Feature 3**: Description

</details>
```

**Do NOT use subheadings** like "### Purpose", "### Features", "### Usage" within the main section. Instead, place usage immediately after the description and put all details in the collapsible section.
