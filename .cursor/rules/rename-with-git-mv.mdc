# Renaming files

When renaming or moving files in this project, **always use `git mv`** so that Git records the rename and preserves version history (e.g. `git blame` and history follow the file).

- **Do**: `git mv old_name.py new_name.py`
- **Don't**: Create a new file, copy content, then delete the old file (that loses history)

Apply the same approach when moving files into or out of directories: `git mv path/to/old path/to/new`.
